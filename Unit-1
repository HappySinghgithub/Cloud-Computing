Ques-2 Cluster and Utility computing
  (a) Cluster Computing   (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/an-overview-of-cluster-computing/)
      Multiple servers are grouped together to achieve the same business and regarded as one computer.
      Cluster computing is a collection of tightly or loosely connected computers that work together so that they act as a single entity. The connected computers execute 
      operations all together thus creating the idea of a single system. The clusters are generally connected through fast local area networks (LANs)

  (b) Utility Computing   (https://www.javatpoint.com/cloud-computing-technologies)
      Utility computing is the most trending IT service model. It provides on-demand computing resources (computation, storage, and programming services via API) and 
      infrastructure based on the pay per use method. It minimizes the associated costs and maximizes the efficient use of resources. The advantage of utility computing 
      is that it reduced the IT cost, provides greater flexibility, and easier to manage.
      Large organizations such as Google and Amazon established their own utility services for computing storage and application.
