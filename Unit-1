Ques-1 What is the difference between Internet and Cloud Computing?
      Internet is a network of networks, which provides software/hardware infrastructure to establish and maintain connectivity of the computers around the word, while 
      Cloud computing is a new technology that delivers many types of resources over the Internet. Therefore Cloud computing could be identified as a technology that 
      uses the Internet as the communication medium to deliver its services. Cloud services can be offered within enterprises through LANs but in reality, Cloud 
      computing cannot operate globally without the Internet.

Ques-2 What is the commercial cloud?
      The commercial cloud refers to cloud computing systems built solely for the paying customer with no specific industry in mind. While some people might mistake a 
      commercial cloud for public cloud solutions, this is often unhelpful. Enterprises can also choose to set up a private cloud ecosystem for themselves within a 
      commercial cloud platform.
      A commercial cloud requires some customization to meet industry-specific requirements especially for businesses functioning within the manufacturing industry. To 
      accomplish the customization process, an enterprise may need to purchase additional management tools or features to accomplish industry-specific tasks. Examples of 
      commercial cloud solutions include Microsoftâ€™s Azure and Amazon Web Services.


Ques-3 Cluster and Utility computing
  (a) Cluster Computing   (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/an-overview-of-cluster-computing/)
      Multiple servers are grouped together to achieve the same business and regarded as one computer.
      Cluster computing is a collection of tightly or loosely connected computers that work together so that they act as a single entity. The connected computers execute 
      operations all together thus creating the idea of a single system. The clusters are generally connected through fast local area networks (LANs)

  (b) Utility Computing   (https://www.javatpoint.com/cloud-computing-technologies)
      Utility computing is the most trending IT service model. It provides on-demand computing resources (computation, storage, and programming services via API) and 
      infrastructure based on the pay per use method. It minimizes the associated costs and maximizes the efficient use of resources. The advantage of utility computing 
      is that it reduced the IT cost, provides greater flexibility, and easier to manage.
      Large organizations such as Google and Amazon established their own utility services for computing storage and application.
